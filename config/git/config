# --- Conditional Includes ---
# This is a modern way to manage multiple work/personal identities.
#
# Usage:
# 1. Create a `~/.config/git/work` file to store only company user information.
#    [user]
#        name = Company Foo
#        email = foo@company.com
#        signingkey = BBBBBBBBBBBBBBB
#
# 2. In the following settings, change `~/workspace/` to the directory path where you store your company projects.
#    Git will automatically load and overwrite the corresponding user settings when entering the directory.

[includeIf "gitdir:~/workspace/"]
    path = ~/.config/git/work
